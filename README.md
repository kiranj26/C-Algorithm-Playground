Welcome to the C Algorithm Playground! This repository is a personal project to explore and implement various algorithms in C, inspired by the open-source repository [TheAlgorithms/C](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Understand and implement different algorithms in C.
- Improve coding skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Create a reference library of algorithms for future projects.

## Structure

The repository is structured into different categories of algorithms, each with its own directory. Each directory contains:
- The C source code file for the algorithm.
- A README file explaining the algorithm and its implementation.

## Documentation

The full documentation for this project can be found [here](https://kiranj26.github.io/C-Algorithm-Playground/).

## Additional Actions

### Code Quality

We use `cppcheck` for static code analysis to catch potential issues early.

### Documentation

We use Doxygen to generate detailed documentation for our code.
