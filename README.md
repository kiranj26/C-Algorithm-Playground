# C Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the C Algorithm Playground! This repository is a personal project to explore and implement various algorithms in C, inspired by the open-source repository [TheAlgorithms/C](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Understand and implement different algorithms in C.
- Improve coding skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Create a reference library of algorithms for future projects.

## Structure

The repository is structured into different categories of algorithms, each with its own directory. Each directory contains:
- The C source code file for the algorithm.
- A README file explaining the algorithm and its implementation.

## Categories

The algorithms are organized into the following categories:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of searching algorithms like Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementations of graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of various data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/C-Algorithm-Playground.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm you want to explore.
3. Compile the C source file using GCC or any other C compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc -o algorithm algorithm.c
    ```
4. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./algorithm
    ```
