Welcome to the C Algorithm Playground! This repository is a personal project to explore and implement various algorithms in C, inspired by the open-source repository [TheAlgorithms/C](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C).

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Understand and implement different algorithms in C.
- Improve coding skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Create a reference library of algorithms for future projects.

## Structure

The repository is structured into different categories of algorithms, each with its own directory. Each directory contains:
- The C source code file for the algorithm.
- A README file explaining the algorithm and its implementation.

## Categories

The algorithms are organized into the following categories:

### Basic
1. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Bubble Sort

## Additional Actions

### Code Formatting

We use `clang-format` to ensure consistent code style across the project.

### Static Code Analysis

We use `clang-tidy` and `cppcheck` for static code analysis to catch potential issues early.

### Memory Leak Detection

We use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

### Code Coverage

We use `gcov` and `lcov` to generate code coverage reports to ensure our tests cover the code effectively.

### Documentation

We use Doxygen to generate detailed documentation for our code.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
